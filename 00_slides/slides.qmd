## Key Takeaways

::: {.incremental}
- All three Posit professional products (Workbench, Connect, Package Manager) have extensive support for Python data science.

- We have extended our open-source mission to include Python with project like Vetiver, Shiny for Python, and Quarto.  We also financially support Python open source by sponsoring Numfocus.

- Given our deep history with R, and our extensive support for Python, Posit Team is great for bilingual data science teams.

- **Posit Team is an excellent solution for Python only teams.**
